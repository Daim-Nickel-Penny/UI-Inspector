# UI-Inscpector

A **chrome extension** for the **UI/UX designers**.
Built using JS for computation and HTML/CSS for front-end.

## What is the purpose of Extension?

**UI-Inspector** works in the website and gives you the ability to edit the websites in realtime. The extension bypasses developer tools hassle and gives you the power to **edit the text** directly **without editing** the **HTML** part.

## But what after editing?

Once you are done editing, you need to share the new text with others or want to save it for the future referece.
So, we have the screen capturing button too. This saves the screenshot of the viewport of the website and saves it in your local machines.
You can simply Toggle the UI-Mode and then once you are done editing, can capture the image and share further.
